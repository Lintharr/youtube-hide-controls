Hide YouTube video controls
============================

Get the add-on from the [Mozilla add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-controls/).

This is a basic add-on that hides the YouTube full screen video player controls.
At the moment the flowing features are implemented:

- Hide the video controls when you move the cursor to the left border
- Hide the controls when you press the configurable hotkey
    -  default: numpad-coma
