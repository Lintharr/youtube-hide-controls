# Hide YouTube video controls

Fork of Hide YouTube video controls, changing mainly how fullscreen works and adding some other QoL features.
Written as a Chrome extension.

Get the original Firefox add-on from the [Mozilla add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-controls/).

Does YouTube leave the video controls visible for longer than you'd like? Do you get annoyed by how clunky YouTube fullscreen is?
This add-on changes YouTube fullscreen to behave more like Media Player Classic's.

Features:
- display video controls or title only when you are hovering over them
- allows you to control volume from anywhere on the video screen with your mouse scroll
- block the annoying page scrolling while at fullscreen

This is a private Chrome extension, but you can occasionally find me and the source code [here](https://github.com/Lintharr/youtube-relish).
